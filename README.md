## Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 3.7 and higher. It requires working
repositories for client packages, they won't be delivered within this module. Please read the
support documentation on how you can get the necessary packages and provide them via a local
repository (search for createrepo to see how this could be done).

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 6/7
* Scientific Linux 6
* CentOS Linux 6/7

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed.

The documentation isn't feature complete yet and not all functions are documented.
